# Next.js Blog Template

Hey Folks! This is the repository I made while learning Next.js , I hope you will find this helpful.
I have not used any database & used the file system module of Node.js to populate the blogs by using fetch API. So for some obvious reasons this website won't work perfectly if we host it as it is at the moment. But for the sake of learning you can follow the below steps .
## Installation

Run these commands

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/anukulpandey/Next.js-Blog codinghunter
  cd codinghunter
  npm install 
  yarn dev
```
After running these commands , the website will be available at http://localhost:3000
